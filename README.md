best cmus simple lyrics player out there

unfortunately it uses traditional polling system couldve used playerctl since the beginning

Currently implementing this out
```bash
playerctl metadata --format "{{playerName}}, {{ artist }}, {{ title }}, {{ duration(position) }}, {{ uc(status) }},{{ duration(mpris:length) }}"
```
the dbus does not actually implement properly still doing traditional polling, I know this isnt the right approach to the lrc control but I will need to go through some of the documentation before executing all that

tbh i am happy to introduce this that this program now works on any music player that works with playerctl


Scrollable lyrics btw 

very customizeable


run this script with these requirement  installable through pip if doownloaded directly through the source code


It detects your custon config.json (monfiable btw) make sure you backup this json configurations






will attempt to get a2 working

also need better instrument detection


hmm i wanted to add option to allow tab like functionality to be able to edit the setting in curses interface
